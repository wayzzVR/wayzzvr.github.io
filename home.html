                    Meet GLadOS! Aperture has done it, putting the human mind into a robot. We  believe our creation so much we've let it run the lab. "Sir, isn't that risky-" Yes! Especially with the amount of [<s>redacted</s>] in this lab. The monitoring systems are right here. As you see, we monitor everything happening. -Aperture Founder, Anonymous.
